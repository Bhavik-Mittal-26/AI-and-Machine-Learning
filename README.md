📊 Mini Project - Data Preprocessing & Regression Model

📌 Introduction

This project focuses on end-to-end data preprocessing and regression model building. The main objective is to clean, transform, and prepare raw data for machine learning tasks, followed by implementing an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression model. It demonstrates important concepts of data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical data, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
