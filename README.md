4)# 📊 Naive Bayes on Healthcare Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies **Naive Bayes classifiers** (GaussianNB & BernoulliNB) on a healthcare dataset (Diabetes Prediction). The aim is to classify patients as **diabetic or non-diabetic** based on various health parameters such as glucose, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, etc.

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

### 1. Data Preprocessing

* Loaded the diabetes dataset.
* Replaced invalid values (like 0 in Glucose, BloodPressure, Insulin, SkinThickness, BMI) with **NaN**.
* Imputed missing values using **median strategy**.
* Applied transformations to handle skewness:

  * `np.log1p()` for Insulin
  * `np.sqrt()` for SkinThickness
* Feature engineering:

  * Created bins for **Age Groups** (20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60+)
  * Created BMI categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)
* Converted categorical bins into dummy variables.
* Scaled numerical features using **StandardScaler**.

---

### 2. Model Training

Two models were trained and evaluated:

* **Gaussian Naive Bayes** → Suitable for continuous features.
* **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** → Suitable for binary features.

---

### 3. Model Evaluation

* Compared **Train Accuracy** and **Test Accuracy** of both models.
* Used metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**.
* Observed class imbalance (500 non-diabetic, 268 diabetic cases) → considered in evaluation.

---

## 📈 Results

* **GaussianNB** generally performs better for this dataset since features are continuous.
* **BernoulliNB** can still be tested after binarizing features.
* Both models provide a good baseline for classification.
