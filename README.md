# Data Preprocessing Pipeline

This repository contains a mini project on **data preprocessing** using Python in Jupyter Notebook.
The project demonstrates step-by-step cleaning and transformation of a dataset containing both **categorical and numerical features** to prepare it for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

---

## 🔹 Features of the Project

* Column renaming and proper naming conventions
* Removing unwanted characters (%, years, months, etc.)
* Handling missing values in numerical and categorical data
* Splitting dataset into numerical and categorical subsets
* Correlation analysis for numerical features
* Outlier treatment using median replacement
* One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables
* Merging cleaned numerical and categorical datasets into a final processed dataset
